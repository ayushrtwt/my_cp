Unique elements and Random order

In most of the cases time complexity is **big O(1).** very rarely go to big O(n)

all functions work only lower bound and upper bound doesnâ€™t work

```cpp
unordered_set<int> st;
   //lower_bound and upper_bound function doesn't works, rest all functions are same
   //no particular order, it has a better time complexity
   //then set in most cases, except some when collision happens

```
